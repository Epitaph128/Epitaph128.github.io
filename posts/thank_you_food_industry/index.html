		<div>They say “don’t bite the hand that feeds you” and I think this is particularly important for humanity to remember going into 2023. Instead of biting, one needs to thank the hand that feeds them instead! Unfortunately, it feels like nothing said quite makes up for the generosity of the hard working farmers and servicemen and women who sustain the economy through difficult times. We should also thank the hand which doesn’t strike against the generosity displayed in American culture in the form of food stamps for the needy. </div>
<div>
<br>I think it’s important to have a broadened world view when it comes to this charity. The government is obviously footing the bill for the food provided to the needy, so the best way likely to return the charity is to simply be productive and pay taxes. For those that can’t, I think it’s best to try to love the community as much as possible and not harbor negativity unnecessarily. </div>
<div>
<br>Perhaps to calm fears that this charity is in vain, people receiving it could pledge allegiance to the flag as a requirement for receiving food stamps. Many lives have been led and lost to protect the freedoms and communal good will that still lingers on in America and I think bolstering the spirits of those that protect it is what Jesus would want from us. </div>
<div>
<br>The question that may arise is to what extent the federal government supports the program or simply allows it to operate. Obviously tax payers are the ones providing funding for the program in times of plenty. We count on the government to save for times of recess, and the system seems to work. The government needs to be thanked as well for having the wisdom to maintain a working system even when it seems to be off the rails. </div>
<div>
<br>Some things arise as possible ideas to help resolve issues. For instance, having a job agency for people on food stamps who are work-capable would possibly alleviate the burden over time and if nothing else provides valuable statistics and psychology for experts to work with to help address the issue at the cultural unconscious level. This information can be traded with other nations even if things locally become too dire to fix. </div>
<div>
<br>For the faithful, we believe that these things are being done but ashamedly aren’t celebrated enough. </div>
