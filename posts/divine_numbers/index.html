<p>Below is a quick rundown of the divine numbers I look for in nature and in other realms such as music or art. This is my own personal system which is based on experience and observation, not on concrete facts.</p>

<p>1 – Ping/I’m alone, Solitude<br>
2 – Pair/Balance (i.e. Love/Hate), Twist, Echo/Reverse Effect<br>
3 – Stable/Complete<br>
4 – Holy/Unholy, Cycle<br>
5 – Strength, Power<br>
6 – Change<br>
7 – Divinity, Renewal<br>
8 – Continuum/Balanced Cycles<br>
9 – Truth/Communication<br>
10 – Completion, Temperance<br>
11 – Fortune<br></p>

<p>These numbers have come to mean these things to me from experience, such as hearing dogs barking while I’m thinking certain thoughts. Or observing ancient artworks, and noticing familiar patterns across many. This may sound strange, or even crazy, but many mystical/divining methods aren’t provable and are mostly an amusement.</p>

<p>However, fortune telling in general does seem to carry a “magical” quality. I hypothesize this is due to some kind of quantum shift in the semantic flow of life, where prior to the prediction the people waiting to receive it are in an anticipatory state making their own predictions of the result. Afterwards, the result is imprinted in time, and then henceforth everyone including the witnesses of the fortune telling incident are living in one of many (however many options there were) “universes”.</p>

<p>Once a fortune is “prescribed” to the person being read, they must choose to accept or reject the prediction. Either way, the prediction itself becomes like a fork in the rivers of the mind. They may start seeing signs that the fortune was correct or incorrect, as they determined when seeing it. However, it’s more likely they’ll start seeing signs related to the fortune in general as they begin to look out for them.</p>

<p>Perhaps study these numbers and then look out for them in your own artwork or musical creations and see if they make sense contextually to you. They don’t always line up, and sometimes it requires stretching the imagination, however, the system can lead to a creative approach of coming up with art if one commits to its encoding.</p>
