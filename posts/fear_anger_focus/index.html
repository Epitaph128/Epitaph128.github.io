<p>When living or fighting a moral battle, one has to combat fear and anger to remain focused. Sources of these emotions need to be dealt with immediately. If someone continuously causes you to become afraid or angry, then avoid them or confront the situation. The key to remaining focused is to listen to God and tune out other sounds. This, I’d say, is a more advanced spiritual method but is one that evolves when fighting evil for long enough.</p>

<p>When fighting, focus on one primary goal at a time. Pursue it with justice in mind; acknowledgment that balance exists in everything. The longer the fight goes on, the more tempered you will become if you resist striking and effectively block any incoming attacks. The enlightened spiritualist will not seek to kill the opponent, but instead cause them to submit to their will.</p>

<p>A fight is essentially a disagreement over truth in some way. The most basic is a disagreement over who has the most power over the situation. The power of God is infinite however, so human’s relative power is essentially nothing. Other times the fight can be vane; determining who’s the most beautiful or talented, etc. Remain humble and recognize true charisma is the pure desire to make friends and not enemies.</p>

<p>Males and females don’t differ in how they come to trust one another. We will typically playfully bully one another until some exchange/rapport is created. The purpose of this rapport is to enhance the strength of the union in a dualistic growth process. Recognize that even a partnership with evil is beneficial if one remains focused on God, for example in forced marriages. Your partner may never recognize the benefits they bring to you, but if one is inwardly aware then one can see the effects it has. </p>

<p>Ceremony is required in any union to create a window of time with which to glimpse the life cycle in a new light. Ceremony can be any activity or event that you perform multiple times. These events enhance our values and trust in one another's growth. Plus they serve as a time for recreation and the establishing of new partnerships.</p>

<p>The antidote to power is peace; if the enemy or opposition is strong then appear weak. If they are loud and boastful, then remain quiet and listen. One has to place themselves in Heaven watching the situation objectively while it’s unfolding. The opponent’s strategy first needs to be counter-balanced in order to control them while a plan is enacted.</p>

<p>Equality needs to occur if true communication can happen. This happens transiently typically and tragically, but should be prolonged as long as possible. Desires that aren’t mutually shared can become a separating force in a partnership. So can avoidances which are simply desires to not do something. The key to equality is not to draw any conclusions about the other you’re with. You’re both learning simultaneously, so seek to adapt to whatever occurs. Actions can occur from within the partnership or to the partnership and have to be handled realistically.</p>

<p>You should seek to establish an emotional zeal towards living. Recognize good things when you experience them, and feel free to repeat the experiences while they are still enjoyable. Ideally the only pressures should come from God and Satan. Prepare for death by living to spite it. Laughter is the best tool in most cases to handle the tragedies that may occur.</p>
