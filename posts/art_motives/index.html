<p>Art Motives is a dream, goal, and habit planning tool. Please view the terms of service here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c5bpr2rcqqadqitjy72qr/art_motives_terms_of_service.pdf?rlkey=guf0fywnrf5r8fwdw09d1xwp5&amp;dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c5bpr2rcqqadqitjy72qr/art_motives_terms_of_service.pdf?rlkey=guf0fywnrf5r8fwdw09d1xwp5&amp;dl=0</a></p>

<p>Acceptance of these terms is required to use Art Motives.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create dreams, goals, and habits.</li>
<li>Complete these for coin rewards. Dreams give 2,500 coins per completion. Goals give 100-1000 coins dependent on difficulty, with bonuses given for additional steps required beyond 1. Habits give 75 coins per completion (daily goals essentially.) However, this reward increases with streak up to 150 coins per day with discipline. These values may change as the app develops.</li>
<li>Scheduled and unscheduled goals: You can move goals between the schedule and the unscheduled pile easily by clicking the date or the schedule goal button in the unscheduled goal view. This makes managing many goals easy!</li>
<li>Unlock (for now) AI generated artwork using coins to get a visual sense of your progress towards your dreams! I plan to make this system much more advanced in the future if interest builds for the app.</li>
<li>Export a report using your data with optional AI instructions included. This can then be pasted into any LLM of your choice for feedback. It can also generate JSON goals which can then be imported into the schedule by pasting back into the app.</li>
<li>Store notes related to your progress with rich text editing features. These are organized as stream of cards with more recent notes on top. There's a button to collapse the note text and only show the title of the note for easier viewing of many. There are also buttons to move the notes up or down the list for arranging your notes.</li>
<li>View your successes at any time to gain motivation! If more than 30 successes have occurred, you may archive older ones to improve the load time for the page with a built in option. Just click the button on the successes page to archive. These successes still appear on the export report if you answer yes to the query on export.</li>
<li>Set custom date format: This allows the user to display dates throughout the entire app using a different date format of their choosing. I may add more formats as requested over time, but there are a handful offered for now that cover most cases I've encountered.</li>
</ul>
