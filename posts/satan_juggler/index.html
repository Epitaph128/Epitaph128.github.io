<p>I have a theory that Satan deceives the soul by holding it firmly in the grasp of either greed or vanity. In this way, the soul is blind to the truth the other hand holds. These form the horns of the individual. However, paradoxically when both hands are held out, mysteriously the soul vanishes. It’s totally empty under the lens of both dimensions.</p>

<p>Our souls breathe meaning into the world by ignoring greed and vanity. However, the body forms a trinity of sorts. The counter-balance; realization that we will only be here temporarily creates the ultimate truth; our biggest impact can be felt by the truth we bring to others, and love is the purest form of truth.</p>

<p>Satan teaches us that life is about the hunt (if you’re a man.) My theory is Satan is essentially the wisdom of death, dying, and pain. The things we must avoid. The reason to hunt is to avoid starvation, not for the glory of the hunt. The “glory of the hunt” is actually a mask we wear to disguise the sorrow that comes from having to take life to survive.</p>

<p>God teaches us that life is also about expression and communication. By praying to him, we learn to trust our intuitions and also through experiences we learn what effect this can have on us. Wisdom is learning that we must embrace our light and dark sides. Our dark side is best at brooding, planning, and cunning. We can sharpen our intellect in “secret” and then spring to action, solving issues in our light essence.</p>

<p>Life teaches us that risk of death isn’t to be feared, it’s to be conquered. If you’re unfortunate enough to die, oh well. Living without taking risks is death in disguise anyways. Our instincts come from our genetics. Our genetics help form the hardware of our biology. This is essentially a computer which stores knowledge of the past.</p>

<p>By allowing the mind to juggle between the realms of greed and vanity, one realizes that when the focus is lost, the metaphorical ball in between the hands is when the soul feels the most free.</p>
