		<div>The illusion that emotions are costing the soul/spirit something or damaging it in some unrepairable way: No negative emotions can last forever and once they do remit a sensation of relief or even joy may follow. If one does dwell on the negatives for long periods of time, they ought to dwell on the joyful experiences in equal measure so they aren’t misleading themselves. This is where positive affirmations can be useful if one wishes to decrease the up and down swings. However, as I am a scientist, I instinctively feel that more energy and thus higher amplitude moods should lead to enhanced emotional processing and creativity. This being my suspicion, I like to use what I call “logical affirmations.” These are affirmations that instead of telling yourself some positive but perhaps questionable information, you instead tell yourself something logical about the circumstances/situation instead. </div>
<div>
<br>For example, a friend doesn’t show up to an event without telling you. You may use a positive affirmation such as “They may have just forgot but they still like me” for example. While this may be true, the logical mind knows you’re hoping for a positive perspective on the situation. Instead, you could tell yourself something like “They didn’t show up. I know they’re missing out as they are not here.” </div>
<div>
<br>The key point is to use both the creative and logical sides of the brain to create optimism or reframe the scenario in a more positive light. </div>
<div>
<br>You can’t solve it if there are no words for it. </div>
