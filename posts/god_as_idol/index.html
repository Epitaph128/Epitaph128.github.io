		God as an Idol Theory

		<p>Perhaps God and other deities are simply idols. I mean certainly idols are created to represent or honor them. Why have people historically held these idols? Maybe this has something to do with creating a mirror, so to speak, by which the mind can judge itself in accordance with higher virtues, ethics, etc. If this is the case, then religion obviously provides some benefit, as it’s essentially education (reading, writing, music) but also psychological training. It provides the foundation to help people learn to create socially acceptable idols. Organized religion ideally wants people to follow the same idol (having the same virtues in mind) however there may be cases where following one’s heart is necessary.</p>

<p>Things get more complicated when considering the possibility of an afterlife. One may hope that previous souls passing into the next realm may be able to offer us guidance or assistance of some sort. This is obviously hopeful, but following good social values doesn’t seem like it would cripple the soul during its afterlife transit. Of course, everyone has their own views of an afterlife, and if one exists at all. However, I see nothing wrong with fantasizing about it if nothing else but for the entertainment. But life judges life, and if there is some supreme being or beings they no doubt will judge me and my afterlife adventure. Maybe that’s why it’s important to accumulate wisdom over the course of a lifetime. So that when one enters the afterlife, they have some means of measuring their surroundings and interpreting the signs presented to them.</p>

<p>Then, naturally, one can argue that modern education provides all that’s needed in terms of virtue development. I mean, mathematics is taught, music education is usually offered or at least certainly should be. History, government, writing, all the bases seem to be covered. However, then why are school shootings and other public slaughterings increasing? Polarization is mounting and people seem unable or unwilling to discuss the issues, except online where physical violence isn’t a threat. Maybe this is a good adaption or at least a necessary one, as you never know how passionate your audience might be when stirred by your words.</p>

<p>Finally, one may argue for individual spiritual practice and development. Organized religion may be like school, but eventually the student needs to become the master. In order to personally develop further and honor God, they have to learn to trust their instincts while maintaining cohesive spiritual practice and logical analysis of their own behavior. This includes feedback from others as well as self-appraisals that may occur.</p>

<p>The alternative to holding some idol, I believe is hard to imagine. Atheists certainly excel at this effort. Maybe they hold mathematics or physics as their idol. However, these practices don’t really do anything nor offer any guidance for how to live or advise others how to live when necessary. Possibly, they hold other living or dead individuals as their idols and strive to be like them. But what if these people change and you no longer agree with their philosophy? Or if they die, then you essentially freeze them philosophically in time. It seems sad to think that your dead great great grandfather may still be racist years after passing with no reason to be concerned any longer. This hands the power over to them, and you become beholden to their influence.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with respecting and following leaders and celebrities. This is a good way to learn the proper way of doing things if you have no other destination in mind. At least others will likely appreciate you as they seem to appreciate leaders otherwise they wouldn’t have power to begin with. In the end, life is a matter of personal approach. No one else can live it for you, nor would they want to, except maybe machines but of course they’re evil.</p>
