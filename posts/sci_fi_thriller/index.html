		<div>Aliens begin to periodically broadcast menacing images from a remote star system depicting human torture. Messages are sent saying that our DNA has been captured and experiments have begun designed to exterminate us. <br><br>
</div>
<div>People begin to panic as a result. Riots start as peoples’ terrors overwhelm them. They don’t feel the authorities are doing enough and blame the scientists for being too greedy and businesses for trying to capitalize on the event. <br><br>
</div>
<div>One news agency emerges as a beacon of hope amidst the panic. Funding their own scientific studies to safeguard the human genome, they begin to receive large swathes of funding as people dump their life savings into the company. <br><br>
</div>
<div>The oligarchs descend into a drug fueled craze and some kill each other. Others join the aliens’ cause in an attempt to win their respect and begin killing other people. Word of this spreads and distrust is sewn amongst the people. Fortunately a group of oligarchs stands in their path and a war between them begins, with recruitment beginning in many areas around the globe. <br><br>
</div>
<div>Monks and other spiritual groups grow in membership as people, convinced of their doom, resign to the tranquility of meditation. Trade frequency swells as people begin stocking up on goods and building underground shelters. Artists and poets try to inspire the human spirit in an effort to keep motivation high to prepare for what seems to be an inevitable assault in the near future. <br><br>
</div>
<div>The stock market is booming, the people begin to relax as the future seems bright, at least for the upcoming moments. Even the ravaging oligarchs are being defeated and their influence seems to be waning. Mind soothing devices are invented by the scientists to reduce anxiety and help people to sleep. <br><br>
</div>
<div>Evangelicals begin preaching more fervently and the comedians mock them as they still believe everyone is bound to die soon. The government begins increasing taxes to start an anti-alien warfare program. The scientists create a new quantum secure encryption algorithm and efforts to upgrade the internet are begun. <br><br>
</div>
<div>The poets begin crafting a new philosophy to combat the psychological uncertainty ever-present. They obviously don’t want to relinquish power over the situation, but they want to be prepared for the worst. The philosophers bring logic to this chemical emergence and people slowly but surely begin to come around to the preparations that need to be made. <br><br>
</div>
<div>New “super-drugs” are created to harden the intellect however the prices are high and supply limited. Knock-offs emerge which are mostly LSD or ecstasy. A few years pass, and things are going well. Fear of the aliens has mostly subsided and the few that remain afraid are mostly advised into mental health treatment. <br><br>
</div>
<div>However, on one terrible night another series of messages begins to be sent. The messages contain mathematical formulas which describe the fundamentals necessary to construct a weapon which can be used to mine the necessary supplies to fight them, if and when they decide to arrive. This causes confusion among the leadership, as they begin to think the aliens might be giving them a chance or that some other political force has come into being. <br><br>
</div>
<div>Efforts to construct this weapon dubbed “Trojan’s Drill” are begun. Obviously skepticism remains that this tool could be turned against humanity somehow. To mediate this, they devise to create a miniature version of the weapon in a distant cave. They begin drilling into the nearby rock, and discover that the drill interacting with the rock’s surface is creating an interesting chemical reaction. <br><br>
</div>
<div>Samples are isolated and the remaining materials are incinerated. The samples are air-lifted to multiple top universities and a program is started to analyze the samples to see if any useful or dangerous properties are present. They find the samples have a thin film of a new ultra-heavy element. They name it Exterra. <br><br>
</div>
<div>Although it is ultra heavy, it is also flammable. Larger and larger demolitions experiments are conducted and the results are re-assuring that if the aliens send any kind of lumbering craft of a size around the size of even a small moon, it will stand no chance against the missiles that can be created soon. <br><br>
</div>
<div>Missile launch drills are conducted and nearby meteors are targeted with some of the smaller missiles. The drills are a success and the meteors are obliterated. Celebrations erupt while others fear that the missiles might be turned against them. Days pass as the news agencies continue reporting the missile crisis that is brewing. Funding for the military is booming as fears are still present. However, one country begins a campaign to use the missiles for imperialistic purposes. <br><br>
</div>
<div>War discussion begin as to how to destroy the new enemy. Diplomacy has already begun but the efforts seem only to antagonize them. <br><br>
</div>
<div>This could be the logical end to the first movie in a series.</div>
