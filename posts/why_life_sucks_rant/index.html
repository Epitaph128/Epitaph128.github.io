		<div>Bad things are obviously bad </div>
<div>With enough time, one can see the darkness in any good thing </div>
<div>No amount of time can nullify the negative aspects of a bad thing </div>
<div>Good memories you know you can never experience again are considered the best ones </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Therefore, we are living in hell. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Since we’re all being tortured out of our minds, it makes sense to create an alternative world view and latch onto it for dear life. Stubbornly cling to this as if it’s a life raft, although others will surely attempt to drown you, so be prepared. Fortunately they’ll only attack you for what you have, so have nothing and you’ll be safe. The best feelings in life are inexpressible, something meant to selfishly hold on to. There is a natural desire to boast however, so if you do share the experience leave out the bad parts. The past always seems better than the present because it’s already over with. Similarly, having less responsibility is always more enjoyable than the opposite. Perhaps claiming glory for things we aren’t responsible for is a free joy. We’re all so ineffective at changing anything in life that there’s the temptation to have more than one child. Love is just relief from the constant hatred we experience when dealing with most people. The powerless know how to fix the world and powerful know how to maintain its brokenness. Thinking forestalls action; action forestalls thought, so think little and do less and you won’t become too boring. Life is designed to make sure you care at all times about things you can’t control: You’re born and cry because you can’t control your surroundings. You go to school and complain because you can’t control the school. You work for a company and complain because you can’t control the company. Maybe you get elected and then complain since you can’t control the country. Then you remember you can’t control yourself either and resign. We all give up on our values given enough time, and because we have to sleep. Then we re-adopt our values the next morning pretending that it doesn’t matter. We’re all part of a massive distributed computer, so any intelligent thought that appears to us most likely comes from it not from us. </div>
