		Modern Male Concerns for 2023

		<p>Men have to make a choice in life frequently. They must choose between being tough and fighting other men in order to thrive economically and socially at the risk of losing the possibility of intimacy with women. Other men forgo this and seek instead to convey love to the world, at the risk of other men using their love to cheat the system thus running out of potential mates as a possible consequence. Over time, the great warriors and artists have built up increasingly complex systems to the point where the modern male cannot live up to either standard and thus many men simply give up and resort to evil because there’s no other alternative way to survive. Some men have become more advanced and are able to cultivate strength and toughness towards other men while being able to switch to a more intimate psychology which they keep secret from other men. However, privacy intrusions expose them and the world calls them liars when they’re really just doing the only thing left in order to love and fight to survive.</p>

<p>Many great love songs have been written, so if a man is a musician unfortunately they’re likely just to sing the songs written by others since they can’t measure up to the talent. Women have already heard all these songs and tragically settle for men who are imitating their ancestors rather than waiting for a visionary who offers something unique, as it’s becoming rarer over time. In the strength domain, men are cursed by history, unable to outclass their ancestors in terms of their brutality as a limit was reached where any increase in brutality would surely mean the end of the species. Even if extremely powerful weapons were created that could wipe out an entire nation of people, the ones pushing the button are simply showing the courage to plunge into hell for the benefit of others and to no benefit to themselves. </p>

<p>The only solution I can see is for people to collaborate to build great things. Songs could be crowd sourced in order to spread out the glory so that at least a larger amount of men can claim responsibility for its existence. Open source software was intended to do this, as the engineering concerns have grown too large for anyone to claim glory truthfully over the creation of a piece of software. Even large corporations rely on scientific discoveries from other cultures, and the work of open source developers as it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel and it’s a waste of resources to do so. The world has become dominated by liars and thieves because of this. Only a miracle can save us from this spiraling towards Hell and the eradication of human life.</p>

<p>Some people, such as trans-humanists have already conceded this and try to increase their intelligence, strength, cool factor, or whatever other aspect of virtue because they feel inferior due to the lack of cooperation. Others have conceded their individuality, joining hive minds or companies which prohibit individual thought in search of glory as a group. They maintain their humanness, but feel lacking as they don’t have much of a personality to share with others. They only have their achievements as validation for their existence. Both groups can become jealous of the others, as the individualists naturally are left out so they feel left out as a result. The hive-minders are included but they lose faith in humanity to produce anything new or interesting because they can no longer imagine anything new or interesting as a result of losing their individuality.</p>

<p>I wish I had a solution to these issues, but due to my own limited intelligence I can’t think of an answer yet. Perhaps this is something that needs to be researched in order to come up with a compromise that doesn’t eradicate the beauty of life. We only have a limited amount of time to come up with a solution before time decides for us and then all of humanities struggle will become paramount to nothing but physics.</p>
