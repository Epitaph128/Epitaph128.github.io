		<div>A game show designed to test the wisdom of the participants. Given a topic from history, the participants must craft a parable and then animate it to teach some lesson from the topic presented.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For example the Y2K Scare: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem#:~:text=The%20Year%202000%20problem%2C%20also%20known%20as%20the,for%20dates%20in%20and%20after%20the%20year%202000.">Year 2000 problem – Wikipedia</a> could be used as an example topic. Perhaps one group may decide to craft a parable about faith and how it should have been or was applied by people to deal with the crisis. Another group could teach the wisdom of precaution and careful steps taken to avoid disaster. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>At the end the groups present their animations and then the audience can vote over a few factors to score the groups’ efforts. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Potential Factors: Creativity, Logical Structure, Moral Value, Relevance </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The purpose of the show, other than commercial success, is the bring awareness and an element of fun to studying history. It still obviously bears significance over current affairs, and this likely will never end nor should it. </div>
